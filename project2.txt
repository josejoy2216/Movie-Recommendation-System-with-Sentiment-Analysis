mood = input("How are you feeling today? (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed, etc.)")

if mood == "happy":
  print("We recommend watching a comedy, like 'Bridesmaids' or 'The Hangover'.")
elif mood == "sad":
  print("We recommend watching a drama, like 'The Pursuit of Happyness' or 'A Walk to Remember'.")
elif mood == "stressed":

Code:
import pandas as pd

# load movie dataset
movies = pd.read_csv("movies.csv")

# ask questions to gather information about user's mood
mood = input("How are you feeling today? (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed, etc.)")
stress_level = int(input("On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your current level of stress?"))
energy = input("Are you feeling energized or tired?")
content = input("Are you feeling content or discontent with your current situation?")

# create an empty list to store recommended movies
recommended_movies = []

# filter dataset based on user's mood and other factors
if mood == "happy":
    recommended_movies = movies[(movies['genres'].str.contains("Comedy")) & (movies['rating']>7) & (movies['year']>2010)]
elif mood == "sad":
    recommended_movies = movies[(movies['genres'].str.contains("Drama")) & (movies['rating']>7) & (movies['year']>2010)]
elif mood == "stressed":
    recommended_movies = movies[(movies['genres'].str.contains("Thriller")) & (movies['rating']>7) & (movies['year']>2010)]
elif mood == "relaxed":
    recommended_movies = movies[(movies['genres'].str.contains("Romance")) & (movies['rating']>7) & (movies['year']>2010)]

# if no movies found or dataset is empty
if recommended_movies.empty:
    print("Sorry, we couldn't find any movie for your mood.")
else:
    # print the recommended movies
    print("Based on your mood, we recommend the following movies:")
    for i in range(len(recommended_movies)):
        print(recommended_movies.iloc[i]['title'])

This code uses the pandas library to read a movie dataset from a CSV file, then it prompts the user to input their mood and other related information. Next, it uses an if-elif statement to filter the movies dataset based on the user's mood and other factors, such as year and rating. Finally, it prints the recommended movies, if any.
You can replace the "movies.csv" with your dataset and also you may want to add more conditions to filter the dataset based on your requirement.
It's important to have good quality of data in dataset to get the accurate results.
